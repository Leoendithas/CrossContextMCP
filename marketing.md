## 13. Post-Project: How to Present This

### GitHub Repo
- **URL:** `github.com/leonedithas/crosscontextmcp`
- **README:** Lead with the problem, not the tech
- **Badges:** Add "MCP Compatible", "Python 3.10+", license badge

### Application Cover Letter Addition
_"To demonstrate my understanding of MCP and agentic workflows, I built CrossContext - an MCP server that aggregates context from fragmented government systems. The project showcases multi-tool orchestration, trust-by-design with data classification and PII redaction, and production-ready audit logging. You can view the repo and demo at [link]."_

### Interview Talking Points
- **Opening:** "I built an MCP to show I understand the operational fragmentation problem you're solving."
- **During technical discussion:** "Let me show you how I handled trust and safety..."
- **Closing:** "This is just a prototype, but it's designed with production constraints in mind - the architecture scales, the trust model is extensible, and the audit logs are compliance-ready."

### LinkedIn Post (Optional)
_"🚀 Just built CrossContext MCP - a proof-of-concept showing how AI Assistants can solve operational fragmentation in government. Using Model Context Protocol, I connected 5 disconnected systems into one intelligent context layer with built-in data classification and PII redaction. Excited about the potential of agentic AI to make public service work effortless. #AI #GovTech #MCP"_
